# Complaint-Management-System
Revolutionize complaint management with our streamlined system, empowering users, admins, and management alike for efficient resolution and informed decision-making."
 Problem Statement:
    Inefficient handling of complaints within  Organization leads to delays, miscommunications, and a lack of transparency. The absence of a centralized system for lodging, tracking, and resolving complaints among students, faculty, and staff members results in frustration and hampers productivity. There is a pressing need for a comprehensive Complaint Management System that streamlines the process, enhances communication, and provides real-time insights for effective resolution and decision-making.

Project Description
    Our system is divided into three modules:
    
    1️⃣ Admin Module: Authorized admins can efficiently manage data, updating information on class representatives and management members through a secure dashboard.
    
    2️⃣ User Module: Users, including CRs, faculty, and lab technicians, have access to view the status of their complaints and can easily lodge new ones, streamlining the complaint process.
    
    3️⃣ Management Member Module: Authorized management members can track complaint status and utilize visualization tools like bar graphs for insightful decision-making.
    
Built with Node.js, Express.js, MySQL, and JavaScript, our system ensures seamless complaint resolution and informed decision-making.
